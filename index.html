                    Emotion-inducing Virtual Reality (VR) applications are used for diverse purposes, including exposure therapy, psychotherapy, studying human beahviour, and enhancing social skills. An area with limited research, but growing interest, is the use of VR to elicit awe. 
                    Research suggests the emotion can lead to transformative changes in physical and psychological aspects, offering benefits such as improved wellness, increased social interaction and environmental consciousness. However, financial and physical constraints limit access to awe-inspiring experiences.

                <p class="mb-0">
                  When designing a VE intended to elicit fear in participants, it was important to consider how the use of certain themes and fear triggers could produce widely varying results from the expected sample group. It was decided that the content of the VE should be effective in producing overt signs of fear, even in a non-phobic group.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  As the environment aimed to measure participant response to an event where they no longer had control over the main task of the environment, it would be necessary to have the participants complete some dangerous activity

                    <p class="mb-4">
                      <b>Theme.</b> The primary design focus of this VE was to create a fear-inducing scenario, grounded in realism. <em>Acrophobia</em>, or the fear of heights, was chosen as the central fear trigger, rather than horror themes, which have been used in past VR experiments involving fear

                      <b>Location.</b> An elevated, urban construction environment was chosen as the location for the VE. A city scene could be populated with surrounding buildings and street level props, which were thought to be effective in creating a realistic sense of scale. This could also be aided by having the user interact with a construction lift, which would rise to a platform from the street. Finally, the construction environment would provide the obvious, thematically sound interaction task for the VE, in the form of various machine parts that would need to be fixed with a tool </p>

                  In the user study <span class="highlight">(n=36)</span>, we tested whether the sudden restriction of user control has an effect on the fear elicited in a VE.

Importantly, the contents of the simulation were identical aside from this, with the same outcomes for each VE

                  This user study <span class="highlight">(n=43)</span> tests how the elicitation of sadness is affected by different levels of user interaction in VR. The environment used involves a narrative of loss, in which each user adopts a dog, plays with it, and then unexpectedly loses it when it is hit by a car. The environment has two levels of interactivity, one in which the dog and environment do not react to user input, so there is a low sense of interaction, and one in which the dog and environment are highly reactive, leading to a greater sense of interaction. Descriptive results indicate that altering user interaction levels can alter the type of sadness produced. It appears that higher levels of interaction were associated with an activating pattern of sadness, while lower levels induce a more traditionally recognised deactivating pattern of sadness.

                <p class="mb-1">
                  1) The results of the user
                  study largely indicate that higher levels of awe were experienced in
                  the mountain VE compared to the control VE.  </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                  2)  Future studies can
                  enhance the robustness of these findings by conducting a similar
                  experiment with increased control measures. We suggest a larger
                  participant pool, an improved training setup or blocking of subjects to
                  mitigate the impact of lack of VR experience, and a small camera to
                  record goosebumps to develop a more comprehensive understanding
                  of the emotion. </p>
