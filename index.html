                    Emotion-inducing Virtual Reality (VR) applications are used for diverse purposes, including exposure therapy, psychotherapy, studying human beahviour, and enhancing social skills. An area with limited research, but growing interest, is the use of VR to elicit awe. 
                    Research suggests awe can lead to transformative changes in physical and psychological aspects, offering benefits such as improved wellness, increased social interaction and environmental consciousness. However, financial and physical constraints limit access to awe-inspiring experiences.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The goal of this project was to successfully evoke awe in the users using Virtual Reality. Three VR Environments were designed, each incorporating different awe elicitors, to test the effectiveness of awe elicitation in VR through distinct themes that are commonly associated with awe.
                    Uniques environments were chosen to assess the successfulness of different awe-inducing environments in VR. As this was a experimental design project, these three VREs can be used as a basis for future research into the artificial replication of awe experiences. 
                    All three VEs were developed de novo.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  Awe is a complex emotion with many elicitors and has shown to have many positive effects on a 
                  person. Some of the positive effects that awe 
                  can have on people include increasing a person’s satisfaction with life, 
                  altering a person’s perspective and worldview as well as influencing people’s 
                  beliefs as it drives people toward spirituality,
                  
                  This project is an experimental design of awe elicitation in 
                  Virtual Reality. A fantasy virtual environment was designed to 
                  elicit the feeling of awe in the user using various features and 
                  elements that were determined as likely awe elicitors. These 
                  included supernatural creatures, northern lights and 
                  bioluminescence. A user experiment was conducted whereby 10 
                  participants took part and they interacted with both a tutorial 
                  environment and fantasy environment. 
                  
                  The fantasy environment was compared against the tutorial environment and was determined to be 
                  successful in the elicitation of awe in the user.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">
                  The supernatural and natural phenomena were identified as likely 
                  elicitors of awe. This inspired the idea of a fantasy forest environment to 
                  be designed where the user could step into a world which is 
                  completely fictional and one they could never experience in real 
                  life. The immersive ability and sense of ‘Presence’ VR provides 
                  allows this seemingly impossible environment to feel completely 
                  real to the user, increasing its chances of evoking awe from features 
                  that many would find difficult to grasp due to its supernatural 
                  nature. The primary features chosen to elicit awe included the 
                  northern lights, dragons and bioluminescence. The 
                  bioluminescence was ascertained through a glowing waterfall, a 
                  bioluminescent rhinoceros as well as glowing rocks and 
                  mushrooms. A fantasy audio was also included in the VR environment to 
                  enhance the mystical feel of the fantasy world the users explored.

                   A user study of <span class="highlight">(n=10)</span> participants took part in the experiment.
                   Biosensors were placed on the upper body of each participant to capture physiological results
                   and a basic presence, emotion five-point likert scale and Awe Experience Scale questionnaires comprised the self report results.
                   Each participant spent around 5 minutes in the tutorial environment which also acted as the baseline for
                   the physiological and self-report results. The participants then answered all three self-report questionnaires.
                   The participants were then immersed into the fantasy virtual environment where they were able to explore for 5 to 10 minutes.
                   After this, the participants answered the same questionnaires before the biosensors were removed, the particpants were compensated and thanked for their time.

                  1) This experimental design was successful in the elicitation of awe. The environment chosen incorporated useful awe-elicitors to achieve this result.  </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                  2) The increased sense of ‘Presence’ also impacted the extent to which the feeling of awe was evoked in the participants. </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                  3) Future research can use this study as a basis and can expand upon this design, incorporating more and different awe-elicitors and using a larger participant base.
                  Future research can also study how different senses influence awe, other than solely relying on sight and sound.

                  When designing an environment to induce awe using ancient architecture like Petra, 
                  there are several key points in the model that must be considered before the actual development. 
                  These include how realistic we want the model to be, the trade-off between quality and frame rate, 
                  and how are we going to induce awe in the users. The model must ensure that the design respects and represents the ancient architecture of Petra.

                <p class="mb-0">
                  Petra, often referred to as the ‘Rose City’ due to its pink appearance of its sandstone cliff, 
                  and was well known for its spectacular tombs, monuments, and houses that was carved into sandstone cliffs. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  For past centuries, the lost city was little known in the western world due to the limitations of technology and how information travels. 
                  Today, many have read and seen pictures of this magnificent architecture, but few have experienced it in person. 
                  Through this VR project, we aim to build a model of Petra, 
                  allowing users to experience Petra as they are in person and enabling them to immerse themselves into this truly awe-inspiring experience.

                  In the user study <span class="highlight">(n=10)</span>), we tested whether grand ancient architecture like Petra has an effect on awe elicitation in a virtual environment. 
                  All participants went through the same process from the tutorial to the completion of the virtual environment. 
                  The tutorial is 5 minutes long with the main environment being 10 minutes. The participants are allowed to end the tutorial and main environment early if they want to.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  There are two measurements taken during the experiment, objective measures such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) 
                  and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) and subjective measures being the survey participants took before the experiment and questionnaires after conducted the experiment. 
                  The objective analysis was calculated by taking the average HR, RR, and SCL after 3 minutes of the immersion until the end of it, 
                  removing the possibility of measuring the awe effect from the VR experience rather than the environment.  
                </p>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    The <b>objective results</b> reviewed minor different between the HR and RR, which can be negligible. 
                    However, RSA showed that the Petra VE do have an effect that could be awe on participants. The sample size is too small make definitive claims.

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  The subjective measures did show that participants experienced awe in the experiments, followed by amusement and joy. 
                  The scores for questions that is linked to awe emotion score mostly within the medium high to high spectrum (7+/10).

                <p class="mb-4">
                  The environment made can be considered successful in eliciting awe due to positive result for RSA and subjective measure. 
                  However, we cannot make a conclusive station about this project due to limitation in sample size and objective measures (n=10). 
                  More testing and validations are required to make the results be significant to make a definitive claim that participants experienced awe during the experiment.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  This user study <span class="highlight">(n=10)</span>  serves as a pilot investigation into a solution to
                  inducing awe in a virtual environment, with the aim of assisting
                  further research into the emotion and contributing to psychotherapy
                  and the rehabilitation process of depression. The immersive
                  environment comprises a range of known awe-inducing factors all
                  encapsulated in a mountainous scene. Vast mountain landscapes
                  viewed from high above, closeup steep cliffs, real-world audio, and
                  intricate detail were all incorporated into the simulated environment to
                  create an immersive scene. The built scene was tested against a
                  control environment which induced no emotion. As anticipated, the
                  findings demonstrated that the awe-inducing virtual environment
                  elicited higher levels of awe and presence than the control VE. These
                  results affirm the immersive potential of VR in generating awe and
                  offer valuable insights for crafting awe-inspiring virtual
                  environments.</p>
