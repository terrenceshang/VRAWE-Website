                    Emotion-inducing Virtual Reality (VR) applications are used for diverse purposes, including exposure therapy, psychotherapy, studying human beahviour, and enhancing social skills. An area with limited research, but growing interest, is the use of VR to elicit awe. 
                    Research suggests the emotion can lead to transformative changes in physical and psychological aspects, offering benefits such as improved wellness, increased social interaction and environmental consciousness. However, financial and physical constraints limit access to awe-inspiring experiences.

                <p class="mb-0">
                  When designing a VE intended to elicit fear in participants, it was important to consider how the use of certain themes and fear triggers could produce widely varying results from the expected sample group. It was decided that the content of the VE should be effective in producing overt signs of fear, even in a non-phobic group.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  As the environment aimed to measure participant response to an event where they no longer had control over the main task of the environment, it would be necessary to have the participants complete some dangerous activity

                    <p class="mb-4">
                      <b>Theme.</b> The primary design focus of this VE was to create a fear-inducing scenario, grounded in realism. <em>Acrophobia</em>, or the fear of heights, was chosen as the central fear trigger, rather than horror themes, which have been used in past VR experiments involving fear

                      <b>Location.</b> An elevated, urban construction environment was chosen as the location for the VE. A city scene could be populated with surrounding buildings and street level props, which were thought to be effective in creating a realistic sense of scale. This could also be aided by having the user interact with a construction lift, which would rise to a platform from the street. Finally, the construction environment would provide the obvious, thematically sound interaction task for the VE, in the form of various machine parts that would need to be fixed with a tool </p>

                  In the user study <span class="highlight">(n=36)</span>, we tested whether the sudden restriction of user control has an effect on the fear elicited in a VE.

Importantly, the contents of the simulation were identical aside from this, with the same outcomes for each VE

                  When designing an environment to induce awe using ancient architecture like Petra, 
                  there are several key points in the model that must be considered before the actual development. 
                  These include how realistic we want the model to be, the trade-off between quality and frame rate, 
                  and how are we going to induce awe in the users. The model must ensure that the design respects and represents the ancient architecture of Petra.

                <p class="mb-0">
                  Petra, often referred to as the ‘Rose City’ due to its pink appearance of its sandstone cliff, 
                  and was well known for its spectacular tombs, monuments, and houses that was carved into sandstone cliffs. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  For past centuries, the lost city was little known in the western world due to the limitations of technology and how information travels. 
                  Today, many have read and seen pictures of this magnificent architecture, but few have experienced it in person. 
                  Through this VR project, we aim to build a model of Petra, 
                  allowing users to experience Petra as they are in person and enabling them to immerse themselves into this truly awe-inspiring experience.

                  In the user study <span class="highlight">(n=10)</span>), we tested whether grand ancient architecture like Petra has an effect on awe elicitation in a virtual environment. 
                  All participants went through the same process from the tutorial to the completion of the virtual environment. 
                  The tutorial is 5 minutes long with the main environment being 10 minutes. The participants are allowed to end the tutorial and main environment early if they want to.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  There are two measurements taken during the experiment, objective measures such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) 
                  and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) and subjective measures being the survey participants took before the experiment and questionnaires after conducted the experiment. 
                  The objective analysis was calculated by taking the average HR, RR, and SCL after 3 minutes of the immersion until the end of it, 
                  removing the possibility of measuring the awe effect from the VR experience rather than the environment.

                <div class="mb-4">
                    The <b>objective results</b> reviewed minor different between the HR and RR, which can be negligible. 
                    However, RSA showed that the Petra VE do have an effect that could be awe on participants. The sample size is too small make definitive claims.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  The subjective measures did show that participants experienced awe in the experiments, followed by amusement and joy. 
                  The scores for questions that is linked to awe emotion score mostly within the medium high to high spectrum (7+/10).

                <p class="mb-4">
                  The environment made can be considered successful in eliciting awe due to positive result for RSA and subjective measure. 
                  However, we cannot make a conclusive station about this project due to limitation in sample size and objective measures (n=10). 
                  More testing and validations are required to make the results be significant to make a definitive claim that participants experienced awe during the experiment.

                  This user study <span class="highlight">(n=10)</span>  serves as a pilot investigation into a solution to
                  inducing awe in a virtual environment, with the aim of assisting
                  further research into the emotion and contributing to psychotherapy
                  and the rehabilitation process of depression. The immersive
                  environment comprises a range of known awe-inducing factors all
                  encapsulated in a mountainous scene. Vast mountain landscapes
                  viewed from high above, closeup steep cliffs, real-world audio, and
                  intricate detail were all incorporated into the simulated environment to
                  create an immersive scene. The built scene was tested against a
                  control environment which induced no emotion. As anticipated, the
                  findings demonstrated that the awe-inducing virtual environment
                  elicited higher levels of awe and presence than the control VE. These
                  results affirm the immersive potential of VR in generating awe and
                  offer valuable insights for crafting awe-inspiring virtual
                  environments.</p>
